# Airbnb clone project
## Overview

This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb web platform designed to improve understanding of full-stack web development. It aims to replicate Airbnb's core features, such as user listings, property display, and search functionality, while focussing on clean architecture and modular code design.

### Project objectives• Reinforce front-end and back-end development skills
  Practice building scalable, RESTful APIs
  Apply concepts of responsive UI/UX design
  Understand data storage, retrieval, and object modeling
  Collaborate using version control and development best practices

### Tech Stack

### Front-End:
  HTML5
  CSS3
  JavaScript
  Bootstrap (optional for styling)

### Back-end:
 Python
 Flask (or other framework, such as Django, depending on setup)

### Database:
  MySQL

### Development & Deployment:
  Git & GitHub
  Unit Testing
  Command Line Interface (CLI)
  Docker (optional)


  ## UI/UX Design Planning

 ### Design Goals
  Create a user-friendly interface that is responsive across devices.
  Simulate real-world booking flows.
  Use modular, maintainable code.
  Optimise for performance and usability.

### Key Features
  User sign-up and login
  Search and filter listings
  Property detail view
  Simple booking/checkout flow
  Data persistence with database
  Responsive design

### Core Page Overview

Listing View: Displays all properties with filters and search bar. Each card shows image, title, and price.
Detail View: Full info about a selected property—images, amenities, dates, and a “Book Now” button.
Checkout View: Final step showing booking summary, price breakdown, and a confirmation form.


### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A simple, intuitive booking system allows users to search, select, and book properties without difficulty. It increases trust, reduces drop-offs, and improves the overall user experience—all of which are essential for any successful platform.


### Color Styles:

Primary: #FF5A5F
Secondary: #008489
Background: #FFFFFF
Text: #222222
Secondary Text: #717171

### Typography:
Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px

###  Importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design
Identifying the design properties of a mockup is critical for ensuring that the final implementation accurately reflects the designer's vision. It helps developers understand key visual details like layout, spacing, colours, typography, and component structure, reducing guesswork and speeding up the development process. This practice also promotes visual consistency throughout the application and enhances communication between designers and developers by establishing a common understanding of design expectations. It also facilitates early planning for responsiveness and aids in the delivery of a user interface that is both functional and visually consistent with modern UX standards.

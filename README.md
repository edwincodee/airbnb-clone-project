  CSS3
  JavaScript
  Bootstrap (optional for styling)

### Back-end:
 Python
 Flask (or other framework, such as Django, depending on setup)

  ## UI/UX Design Planning

 ### Design Goals
  Create a user-friendly interface that is responsive across devices.
  Simulate real-world booking flows.
  Use modular, maintainable code.
  Optimise for performance and usability.

### Key Features
  User sign-up and login
  Search and filter listings
  Property detail view
  Simple booking/checkout flow
  Data persistence with database
  Responsive design

### Core Page Overview

Listing View: Displays all properties with filters and search bar. Each card shows image, title, and price.
Detail View: Full info about a selected property—images, amenities, dates, and a “Book Now” button.
Checkout View: Final step showing booking summary, price breakdown, and a confirmation form.


### Why User-Friendly Design Matters

A simple, intuitive booking system allows users to search, select, and book properties without difficulty. It increases trust, reduces drop-offs, and improves the overall user experience—all of which are essential for any successful platform.
